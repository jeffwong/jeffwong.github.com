      <section>
        <p>I graduated with an MS from Stanford Statistics in 2012 and am now a Data Scientist at Netflix.  My favorite areas of work are in optimization, computational science, statistical computing, and data visualization. I like making fast and easy to use analytical tools, and am an avid R developer.  Many of my projects are hosted here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/cudaglmnet">cudaglmnet</a> - A CUDA implementation of the R package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html">glmnet</a>.  GPUs have hundreds of more cores than CPUs, their more general purpose counterpart.  As data scales, parallelism becomes a necessity; this package moves computations for generalized linear models with regularization to the GPU, allowing massively parallel linear algebra computations.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/glmnet">glmnet</a> - A mirror of Trevor's R package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html">glmnet</a>.  My dev branch contains some add ons, including a parallelized cross validation function, the ability to use formulas, and useful ggplot functions for plotting coefficients</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/Recipes">Recipes</a> - my cookbook for data analysis in R </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/TimeProjection">TimeProjection</a> - Useful date manipulation in R.  Given a vector of dates, extract all major components that would be useful in a regression model - year, month, day, day of week, business day, holiday, hour, minute, second, etc.  This allows easy grouping, which can then be used to study time effects such as day of week effects and seasonality</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/GeoProjection">GeoProjection</a> - Useful geographic data in R.  Given latitude and longitude, city, zipcode, or state, find useful geographic data such as the state a city is in, or the nearest city given a pair of latitude and longitude.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/imputation">imputation</a> - an R package for filling missing values in a numeric matrix.  Includes kNN, SVD, Singular Value Thresholding, and linear interpolation methods</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffwong/pdist">pdist</a> - a special use case of the R function dist.  Given a data matrix, it may not be necessary to compute all possible pairwise distances.  For example, if the observations form natural groups like in a bipartite graph it may be sufficient to compute distances between group A and group B.  pdist allows the user to compute pairwise distances between two partitions of a matrix</p>

<p><a href="https://jeffwong.github.com/fastVAR">fastVAR</a> - an R package for estimating vector autoregressive models with exogenous variables.  Can apply L1 penalty for sparse estimation.</p>
