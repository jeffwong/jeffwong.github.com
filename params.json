In 2011, I finished a BS in Math and Computational Science from Stanford University and in June 2012 I graduated with an MS in Statistics from Stanford.  While I spend a fair amount of time coding, I enjoy developing analytical tools around applied math and applied statistics.  All my work is open source and is hosted here on github.\r\n\r\n[imputation](http://jeffwong.github.com/imputation) - an R package for filling missing values in a data matrix.\r\n\r\n[fastVAR](http://jeffwong.github.com/fastVAR) - an R package for estimating vector autoregressive models with exogenous variables.
