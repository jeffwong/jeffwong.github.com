To contribute a post, add an RMarkdown file to the `_posts` directory, then knit the post using RStudio, or `rmarkdown::render("<path to this repo>/_posts/<path to the RMarkdown file>")`. To combine the blog with the post, run `rmarkdown::render_site()`. Finally, use git to commit the new post and push it to the repository.
